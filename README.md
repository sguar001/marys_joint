Hello! This a website that I created to showcase a startup business. It details important information such as membership prices, and also information on how to get in contact with the business. It was built with love and with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some PHP to handle to contact forms. It is a modern, responsive website that uses Bootstrap at its core! Here are some screenshots of the site:
